# Game-Visualization
Game Visualization Project
This is a project I did for the Systems for Interactive Data Analysis class at the University of Arizona. 

It should be possible to run the project by putting everything in the same directory and opening the html file in a browser.
The D3 library is included here so that no connection to the internet is needed to use it. 
An explanation of the project can be found in the provided pdf.
